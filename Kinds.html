<h1><u><center>PRODUCERS</h1></u></center>
<p style="font-size:20">These organisms synthesise their own food by photosynthesis.
<p style="font-size:20"> Example: All green 
plants and blue green algae. However, in the strict sense, the plants (or the producers) donâ€™t produce energy. 
They only convert solar energy into chemical energy of food (Transducers).

<h1><u><center>CONSUMERS</center></u></h1>
<p style="font-size:20">These organisms are dependent upon other organism for food. Example: All 
animals including humans. Though in a general sense, we prepare our own food by cooking the raw materials 
used are obtained from either plants or animals which again gain energy from plants only.
<p style="font-size:20">Consumers can be classified as:
<ul style="font-size:20">
<li>Herbivores (Primary consumers)</li>
<li>Carnivores (Secondary consumers)</li>
<li>Omnivores and parasite</li>
</ul>

<h1><u><center>DECOMPOSERS</center></u></h1>
<p style="font-size:20">These consume, and thus decompose, the dead remains of other organisms 
(both autotrophs and heterotrophs). For example, certain bacteria and fungi break down the complex organic 
compounds present in the dead organisms into simple substances. Through the decomposers the elements
(minerals) enter the earth/soil again, which are in turn again taken up by the plants with the help of their roots. 
Thus, the cycle of exchange of matter continues(Biogeochemical cycles). By their activity, the decomposers 
also maintain soil fertility.</p>
