<h1 style="font-size:40"><u><center>INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITIES</u></a></center></h1>
 <p style="font-size:20">Industrial activity has been the biggest contributor to the problem in the last century, especially since the amount of mining and manufacturing has increased. Most industries are dependent on extracting minerals from the Earth.
 Whether it is iron ore or coal, the by-products are contaminated, and they are not disposed of in a manner that cannot be considered safe. As a result, the industrial waste lingers in the soil surface for a long time and makes it unsuitable for use.

<h1 style="font-size:40"><u><center>DEFORESTATION</u></a></center></h1>
<p style="font-size:20">Clearing of trees leaves soil exposed to the elements so they are easily carried away by soil erosion. This leaves land barren and incapable of supporting vegetation.
Because of deforestation and forest fires, soils lose their vegetation cover. The erosion process is thus accelerated, creating soil degradation as well as water pollution. Deforestation leads to the loss of the land's value as, once converted into a dry or barren land, it can never be made fertile again.</p>

<h1 style="font-size:40"><u><center>GARBAGE POLLUTION</u></a></center></h1>
<p style="font-size:20">Finally, a growing cause for concern is how we dispose of our waste. While industrial waste is sure to cause contamination, there is another way in which we are adding to the pollution. Every human produces a certain amount of personal waste products by way of urine and feces.
While much of it moves into the sewer system, there is also a large amount that is dumped directly into landfills in the form of diapers. Even the sewer system ends at the landfill, where the biological waste pollutes the soil and water. This is because our bodies are full of toxins and chemicals which are now seeping into the land and causing pollution of soil.

<h1 style="font-size:40"><u><center>AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITIES</center></u></h1>
<p style="font-size:20">The utilization of chemicals has gone up tremendously since technology provided us with modern pesticides and fertilizers. They are full of chemicals that are not produced in nature and cannot be broken down by it. As a result, they seep into the ground after they mix with water and slowly reduce the fertility of the soil.Other chemicals damage the composition of the soil and make it easier to erode by water and air. Plants absorb many of these pesticides, and when they decompose, they cause soil pollution since they become a part of the land.</p>
